# CSS-Grid-Pixel-Graphics-

------Goal------
The end goal of this project is to create an engine that can simulate graphics using the css grid.
I will start of by creating a small pixelated animation or video game to figure out the basics of how to implement it. 
The next step will be to make it an engine that can render any image as css grid image.
Other steps to be determined...
